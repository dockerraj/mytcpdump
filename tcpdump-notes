Crontab

This is the crontab for an example tcpdump which starts at 02:00am and stops at 02:05am.

0 2 * * * bash /tmp/tcpdump_getdata.sh

# tcpdump -i eth0 -G 3600 -w dump-%H.pcap.

The same rotation applies here. tcpdump creates a new file every 3600 seconds, naming it with the current hour. Upon changing days, the previous hour files are sequentially replaced.


at specific time:

echo "/usr/sbin/tcpdump -ni eth0 -s0 -w /var/tmp/capture_eth0.pcap host 1.2.3.4 and port 80" | at 15:30 


echo "killall tcpdump; killall tcpdump" | at 15:35
